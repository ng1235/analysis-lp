const paraOne = 'At NextGen, our view is that all models are wrong. This is counterintuitive, since providing project economics via a valuation model is the core part of our service. When you explore this further though, this isn’t as far-fetched a view as it might seem.'

const paraTwo = 'Take, for example, a prospective liquids opportunity: think about how difficult it is to forecast an oil price over an entire project period. When you expand that difficulty to all the other required parameters (i.e. capital spend, operating costs, and economic assumptions such as inflation and escalation) over a long time horizon, the possibility that these are collectively correct rapidly approach zero.'

const paraThree = 'Therefore, over-reliance on the numeric outputs of a model is a mistake, and the insistence that a model was a source of truth was a key frustration we experienced in industry. Ultimately, the assumptions (and resulting outputs) underpinning a model are guesswork backed by research at its best, and hubris (to think that one can accurately predict the future) at its worst.'

const paraFour = 'Here at NextGen, we take a different approach. We accept that the parameters in our work are multi-variate and complex, and that the resulting outputs will likely be wrong. Instead, we focus on the directional insights and guidance that a model provides.'

const paraFive = 'More specifically, we look to identify where the potential value in your project lies, as well as key value levers and their impact. In one sense, what we aim to provide to you is a map of the opportunity’s current state. That map might be ill-defined, and whilst it’ll never fully reflect reality, it can serve as an abstraction that can consistently be updated as your opportunity progresses, and more information becomes available.'

const paraSix = 'That abstraction can help you when making decisions and allocating resources. For instance, a decision between focussing on a scoping study on reducing capital spend and negotiations for land lease payments may seem equally important. But, if the former impacts your project economics significantly more, that decision suddenly becomes easier.'

const paraSeven = 'If you share the view that what you work on is more important than how hard you work on it, having a sense of where the value lies in your project can direct you to influencing the areas that matter most. So, whilst our work is ultimately only a simplification of reality, its practical usefulness makes the exercise worthwhile.'

const superscriptOne = 'Here, outputs are separate from logical / modelling errors; the latter is not acceptable.'
