  {
    title: 'What does your service typically involve?',
    answer: "An assessment of your opportunity's life-cycle project economics. We deliver this through an Excel-based discounted cash flow valuation model. Supporting presentation material can also be prepared if desired."
  },
  {
    title: 'How fast can you deliver on our engagement?',
    answer: 'Typically 2-4 weeks. This can be accelerated if required and is subject to agreed project scope.'
  },
  {
    title: 'How much do you charge?',
    answer: 'Pricing is on a project-specific basis and is dependent on its scope - contact for a discussion.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Who is a typical client?',
    answer: 'Development or opportunity managers leading projects in companies where an economic / investment assessment is required for guidance or project momentum. '
  },
  {
    title: 'What industries do you work with?',
    answer: 'Our experience is in the natural resource industry (i.e. liquids, hydrogen / new energy) but can consider alternatives on request.'
  },
  {
    title: 'What makes your service different?',
    answer: "We work on a project-specific basis, and do not require fixed or full-time employment contracts. We deliver to timelines on an 'as-required' basis, as long as it's agreed prior to commencement. We adhere to Excel modelling best practice, and our previous work has been reviewed by external Big 4 valuation teams and other experienced industry consultants ."
  },
  {
    title: 'Who provides the input assumptions for the engagement?',
    answer: "Our work depends on the provision of key technical inputs (i.e. production, capital & operating costs) from yourself. For economic assumptions, we can provide screening level placeholders, or use more specific parameters as desired.",
  },
  {
    title: 'Do you take liability for financial decisions made from your services?',
    answer: "No - our core service is aimed providing guidance & decision support.",
  },
  {
    title: 'Do you guarantee that the outcomes from the analysis you provide will turn out to be materially correct?',
    answer: "No - see our thoughts on this on the 'Models Are Wrong' page.",
  },
  {
    title: 'Is this work appropriate support for final investment decisions?',
    answer: "No - our core work is generally aimed at providing support for early stage projects. It has screening assumptions that are likely too high-level for decisions that require a commitment of large sums of capital. We'd be willing to consider working with you to generate investment decision / decision gate project economics, but that would be an exception rather than a core offering."
  },
  {
    title: 'Do I need to provide a computer or desk arrangements?',
    answer: 'No - we work remotely, though can meet in-person as desired.',
  },
  {
    title: 'How do you determine the scope of the project?',
    answer: "By working with you to understand what kind of problems you're looking to solve with our service. Invariably, it will differ from project to project (or even phase to phase). We only engage if we think that we can help you."
  },
  {
    title: "Are you available for multiple phases of work?",
    answer: "Yes - there's most likely a lot that's left out of an initial analysis, because we only aim to assess and support the objectives that are relevant to you at a certain point in time. We're available on request to assess additional phases, other operating models, or if you require additional functionality in your valuation model."
  },
  {
    title: "Can you help maintain my project model?",
    answer: "Yes - contact for a discussion."
  },
  {
    title: "Can't I just hire a full-time analyst for my work?",
    answer: "Yes. However, this might not be suitable if you have projects that have bursts of work followed by periods where additional analysis is not required. Additionally, the cost of a full-time or fixed-term (e.g. six-month) contract to your business likely exceeds what we'd charge, given our project based pricing."
  },
  {
    title: "Do I get to keep the source documents from our engagement?",
    answer: "Yes, we send through a copy of our valuation & other materials upon completion."
  },
  {
    title: "Do you prepare financial statements?",
    answer: "No - our service involves preparing key investment metrics (i.e. Net Present Value, Internal Rate of Return, etc) based on discounted cash flow analysis."
  },
  {
    title: "Do you consider debt / project financing cash-flows?",
    answer: "No - that's beyond the scope of our service."
  },
  {
    title: "I have further questions",
    answer: "Send a message to hello@xxx.com and we'll revert."
