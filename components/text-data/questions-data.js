  {
    title: 'What does your service involve?',
    answer: "An assessment of your opportunity's life-cycle project economics. We deliver this through an Excel-based discounted cash flow valuation model, with supporting presentation material ."
  },
  {
    title: 'How long will it take?',
    answer: 'Typically 2-4 weeks. This can be accelerated if required and is subject to agreed project scope, which could include new model builds, alternate business model assessments, audits, or negotiation support.'
  },
  {
    title: 'What is the price of your services?',
    answer: 'Pricing is on a project-specific basis and is dependent on its scope.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Who is a typical customer?',
    answer: 'Opportunity leads in companies where an economic assessment is required for guidance or project momentum. '
  },
  {
    title: 'What industries do you work with?',
    answer: 'Our experience is in the natural resource industry (i.e. LNG, liquids, hydrogen / new energy) but can consider alternatives as required.'
  },
  {
    title: 'What makes your service different?',
    answer: "We save you budget by working on a project-specific basis, without full-time employment contracts. Notwithstanding that our previous work has been reviewed by external Big 4 valuation teams and other experienced industry consultants, the price of our service is likely to be lower than an equivalent Big 4 engagement."
  },
  // {
  //   title: 'Who provides the input assumptions for the engagement?',
  //   answer: "Our work depends on the provision of key technical inputs (i.e. production, capital & operating costs) from yourself. For economic assumptions, we can provide screening level placeholders, or use more specific parameters as desired.",
  // },
  // {
  //   title: 'Do you take liability for financial decisions made from your services?',
  //   answer: "No - our core service is aimed providing guidance & decision support.",
  // },
  // {
  //   title: 'Will your model be materially correct?',
  //   answer: "No - see our thoughts on this on the 'Models Are Wrong' page.",
  // },
  // {
  //   title: 'Is this work appropriate support for final investment decisions?',
  //   answer: "No - our core work is generally aimed at providing support for early stage projects. It has screening assumptions that are likely too high-level for decisions that require a commitment of large sums of capital. We'd be willing to consider working with you to generate investment decision / decision gate project economics, but that would be an exception rather than a core offering."
  // },
  // {
  //   title: 'Do I need to provide a computer or desk arrangements?',
  //   answer: 'No - we work remotely, though can meet in-person as desired.',
  // },
  {
    title: 'How do you determine scope?',
    answer: "After an initial obligation-free consult, we then develop a high-level scope of work for your consideration."
  },
  {
    title: 'Is the information shared with you confidential?',
    answer: "Yes; we sign confidentiality agreements on request and maintain strict standards of client confidentiality."
  },
  {
    title: "Are you available for ongoing work or multiple phases?",
    answer: "Yes - there's most likely a lot that's left out of an initial analysis, because we only aim to assess and support the objectives that are relevant to you at a certain point in time. We're available on request to assess additional phases, other operating models, or if you require additional functionality in your valuation model."
  },
  // {
  //   title: "Can you help maintain my project model?",
  //   answer: "Yes - contact for a discussion."
  // },
  // {
  //   title: "Can't I just hire a full-time analyst for my work?",
  //   answer: "Yes. However, this might not be suitable if you have projects that have bursts of work followed by periods where additional analysis is not required. Additionally, the cost of a full-time or fixed-term (e.g. six-month) contract to your business likely exceeds what we'd charge, given our project based pricing."
  // },
  // {
  //   title: "Do I get to keep the source documents from our engagement?",
  //   answer: "Yes, we send through a copy of our valuation & other materials upon completion."
  // },
  // {
  //   title: "Do you prepare financial statements?",
  //   answer: "No - our service involves preparing key investment metrics (i.e. Net Present Value, Internal Rate of Return, etc) based on discounted cash flow analysis."
  // },
  // {
  //   title: "Do you consider debt / project financing cash-flows?",
  //   answer: "No - that's beyond the scope of our service."
  // },
  // {
  //   title: "I have further questions",
  //   answer: "Send a message to hello@xxx.com and we'll revert."
  // }
